# Store the squares in the board and update moves here
board = [[1, 2, 3], [4,"X",6], [7,8,9]]

# Have a list that stores free squares using a tuple as the element
free_squares = []

# This is the control variable until a winner is found
winner = False

# This function accepts one parameter containing the board's current status and prints it out to the console.

        print("+-------+-------+-------+")
        print("|       |       |       |")
        print(" ")
        for column in range(0,3):
            print("|  ", board[row][column], " ", end=" ")
        print("|")
        print(" ")
        print("|       |       |       |")
    print("+-------+-------+-------+")

# This function browses the board and builds a list of all the free squares; the list consists of tuples, while each tuple is a pair of row and column numbers.
def make_list_of_free_fields(board):
    for index, column in enumerate(board): # iterate through the board and add the corresponding element from index to free squares list
        free_squares.append(tuple(column)) # convert the column list to a tuple and add it to the free squares list, the computer choose from this
