# Purpose: Write a tic tac toe program that plays the computer. Section 4.7.2.1

# import random module to generate computer moves
from random import randrange

# Store the squares in the board and update moves here

# Have a list that stores free squares using a tuple as the element
free_squares = []

# This function accepts one parameter containing the board's current status and prints it out to the console.

        print("+-------+-------+-------+")

        print("|")
        print(" ")
        print("|       |       |       |")
